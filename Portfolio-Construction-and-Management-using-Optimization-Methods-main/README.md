# Portfolio-Construction-and-Management-using-Optimization-Methods

This project walks through the implementation process of the Mean-Variance optimization
(MVO) method as well as the Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) optimization method on a
selected dataset consisting of 10 indices with high and low volatilities. The process includes
the estimation of expected return and covariance matrix, optimization methods aiming at
particular goals, and rebalancing procedures for both threshold rebalancing and fixed-time
rebalancing. It then analyzes the performance of each of the methods compared to that of the
1/n equally weighted (EW) method. The major conclusion is that most MVO and HRP models
cannot beat the EW model in terms of portfolio return, but MVO with yearly rebalancing
might be the most superior in terms of overall performance. The paper also further discusses
the limitations and potential improvements of each of the methods at the end.
